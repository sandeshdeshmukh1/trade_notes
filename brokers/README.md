Different brokers have different export options so on this page you will find instructions for some of the brokers supported by TradeNote.

Export instructions are written with the help other TradeNote users in the community. Contact me if you want to contribute as well.

You contact me via [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZbHekKYb85 "Discord") if you wish to integrate your broker. Alternatively, you can use the [template](https://github.com/Eleven-Trading/TradeNote/blob/main/brokers/Template.csv "template") and adapt it to your export file.

#### Cleanup before importing to TradeNote
Before attempting to import data, there are a few things that may help.
- Remove any empty lines that may be present in your CSV file
- If multiple accounts are present, isolate them to 1 account at a time
- If trading options, futures, etc., ensure the Underlying Symbol exists
- May need to set the Underlying Symbol as the ticker from the Symbol column
- Sort the trades by Order Time

- Remove any Open Trades
- Add an Order Time to Expired Contracts rather than leaving the fields empty
- Format prices to 2 decimal places to prevent dealing with floating point precision errors
